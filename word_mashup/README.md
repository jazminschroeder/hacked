# Word Mashup

***


## The Hack:
Let's try mashing up two web APIs.  We'll write a web app to look up a misspelled word to get a list of suggested corrections from one API and their definitions from a different API.

That will give us all some practice with Sinatra (or your favorite web framework) and using and understanding APIs.

[Definitions API](http://developer.wordnik.com/)


## Here is a way to do it...try it!
